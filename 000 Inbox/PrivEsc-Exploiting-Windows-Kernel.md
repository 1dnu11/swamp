# PrivEsc - Windows Kernel Exploitation

## Overview
- A Kernel is a computer program that is the core of an operating system. It has complete control over every resource and hardware on a system.
- Windows NT is the kernel that comes with all versions of Windows. It consists of two main modes of operation that determines access to resources:
    - User Mode - Programs and services have limited access to system resources and devices
    - Kernel Mode - Unrestricted access to system resources with added functionality of managing devices and system memory
- Kernel exploits will typically target vulnerabilities in the kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to elevate privileges on the system.

## Useful Tools
- [Windows-Exploit-Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester) - Compares a target patch level against Microsoft vulnerability DB in order to detect potential missing patches. It also notifies if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available.
- [Windows-Kernel-Exploits](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits) - Collection of Windows Kernel exploits sorted by CVE.


### Commands
#### Metasploit
*Search Vulnerabilities for specific OS Version (Metasploit)*
```bash
msf5 > use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```
