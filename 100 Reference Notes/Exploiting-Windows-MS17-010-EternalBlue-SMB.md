# Exploiting Windows MS17-010 SMB Vulnerability

## Overview
- EternalBlue was used in the WannaCry attack to spread the ransomware to as many systems as possible.
- Patch was released in March, 2017, and yet there are still vulnerable systems out there.
- An MSF auxiliary module can be used to check if a target system is vulnerable to the exploit.


## Further notes
Since this vulnerability is so common, and since I've already exploited it a couple of times in some CTFs, I've decided to totally the videos/labs that involved the MS17-010 vulnerability.
